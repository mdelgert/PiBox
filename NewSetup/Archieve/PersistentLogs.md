The error suggests that the `syslog` file doesn't exist in the redirected `/mnt/d1/logs/`. This could happen because systemd-journald may not create a `syslog` file directly when `Storage=volatile` is set in the configuration or due to permissions issues.

Here's how to address the issue:

---

### **1. Verify `systemd-journald` Configuration**
Ensure that logs are being stored persistently. Edit `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

- Look for the `Storage` setting and set it to `persistent`:
  ```ini
  Storage=persistent
  ```
- Restart the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
  ```

---

### **2. Verify Permissions**
Ensure `/mnt/d1/logs` has the correct ownership and permissions for logging:
```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /mnt/d1/logs
sudo chmod -R 750 /mnt/d1/logs
```

---

### **3. Test Logging Again**
After making the above changes, try logging a test entry again:
```bash
logger "This is another test log entry"
```

Check if the logs are now available:
```bash
sudo tail /mnt/d1/logs/syslog
```

---

### **4. Troubleshooting**
If the issue persists:
1. **Check journald Logs**:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u systemd-journald
   ```
   Look for errors or warnings related to logging.

2. **Ensure `rsyslog` is Installed and Running**:
   Some systems require `rsyslog` for writing to `syslog` files:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install rsyslog
   sudo systemctl enable rsyslog
   sudo systemctl start rsyslog
   ```

3. **Inspect Log Directory**:
   Check if logs are being redirected correctly:
   ```bash
   ls -l /mnt/d1/logs/
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**
- Update the `Storage` setting in `journald.conf` to ensure persistent logs.
- Fix permissions on `/mnt/d1/logs`.
- Ensure `rsyslog` is installed if required by your system.

Once these adjustments are made, the test log entry should appear in `/mnt/d1/logs/syslog`. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
