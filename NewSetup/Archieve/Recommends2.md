Given your setup with two 2TB SSDs and a 4GB eMMC on a Raspberry Pi, the configuration should be tailored for performance, durability, and reliability. Hereâ€™s the optimized `/etc/fstab` file with the necessary changes for your setup, followed by detailed explanations and optional steps:

### **Updated `/etc/fstab`**
```bash
proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
PARTUUID=06cddfcd-01  /boot/firmware  vfat    defaults          0       2
PARTUUID=06cddfcd-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
UUID=7dadb049-3b3d-4fcf-ac0c-de1f60f90542 /mnt/d1 ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail 0 2
UUID=aed28b67-eb8b-4a09-9e42-dedc2b64e2c6 /mnt/d2 ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail 0 2

# Swap file on SSD /mnt/d1
/mnt/d1/swapfile none swap sw,pri=0,nofail 0 0

# Optional: Temporary files in RAM to reduce eMMC writes
tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=0755,size=100M 0 0

# Optional: Logs in RAM to reduce eMMC writes
tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=0755,size=50M 0 0
```

### **Explanation of Changes**

1. **eMMC Optimizations**
   - **`defaults,noatime`**: Reduces write cycles on the eMMC by disabling access time updates for every file read.
   - **Ensure minimal usage of eMMC**:
     - Store Docker data, Samba shares, and logs on the SSDs.
     - Mount `/var/tmp` and `/var/log` as `tmpfs` (RAM-based).

2. **SSD Mount Points (`/mnt/d1` and `/mnt/d2`)**
   - **`defaults,noatime,nofail`**:
     - `noatime`: Prevents frequent metadata updates, reducing unnecessary writes.
     - `nofail`: Allows the system to boot even if an SSD is missing or fails.

3. **Swap on SSD**
   - SSDs are better suited for swap than the eMMC due to higher endurance and capacity.
   - A 2GB swap file on `/mnt/d1` with `nofail` ensures system functionality even if the SSD is unavailable.
   - Configure the swap:
     ```bash
     sudo fallocate -l 2G /mnt/d1/swapfile
     sudo chmod 600 /mnt/d1/swapfile
     sudo mkswap /mnt/d1/swapfile
     sudo swapon /mnt/d1/swapfile
     ```

4. **Temporary Files in RAM (`/var/tmp`)**
   - Storing temporary files in RAM reduces eMMC wear.
   - Adjust the `size` (e.g., `100M`) to match your workload.

5. **Logs in RAM (`/var/log`)**
   - Keeps logs in RAM to minimize writes to the eMMC.
   - Logs will be lost after a reboot unless configured to persist (e.g., on SSD).

   **To make logs persistent on SSD:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/d1/logs
   sudo rsync -a /var/log/ /mnt/d1/logs/
   sudo ln -sf /mnt/d1/logs /var/log
   ```

---

### **Optional Enhancements**

1. **Docker Storage on SSD**
   - Relocate Docker storage to `/mnt/d1` to prevent high write operations on the eMMC:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /mnt/d1/docker
     sudo rsync -a /var/lib/docker/ /mnt/d1/docker/
     echo '{"data-root":"/mnt/d1/docker"}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

2. **Samba Shares on SSD**
   - Configure Samba to use `/mnt/d1` or `/mnt/d2` for shared directories:
     ```ini
     [d1share]
     path = /mnt/d1
     writeable = yes
     browseable = yes
     guest ok = no
     create mask = 0775
     directory mask = 0775
     ```

3. **Backup Using `/mnt/d2`**
   - Use `/mnt/d2` for snapshots or backups of critical data:
     ```bash
     sudo rsync -a / /mnt/d2/backup --exclude=/mnt
     ```

4. **Monitor Disk Health**
   - Use `smartctl` to monitor SSD health:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install smartmontools
     sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda  # Replace with your SSD device name
     ```

### **Testing and Validation**

1. **Test the Setup**:
   - Verify mounts:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```
   - Check swap:
     ```bash
     swapon --show
     ```
   - Reboot and confirm all services and mounts are functional:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

2. **Simulate SSD Failure**:
   - Temporarily unmount an SSD:
     ```bash
     sudo umount /mnt/d1
     ```
   - Confirm the system remains operational.

---

### **Summary**

- **eMMC**: Minimized writes with `noatime` and RAM-based `/var/tmp` and `/var/log`.
- **SSDs**: Use for swap, Docker, and Samba storage with resilient `nofail` configurations.
- **Persistence**: Redirect logs and critical data to SSDs for durability.
- **Backups**: Use `/mnt/d2` for snapshots to ensure data safety.

These changes strike a balance between performance, reliability, and longevity for your setup.
