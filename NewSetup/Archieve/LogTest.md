Yes, writing a log entry and then searching for it is a more effective way to test the setup. This ensures that logs generated by system processes or services are being correctly redirected to the SSD. Here's how you can perform a better test:

---

### **Test Writing Logs to `/var/log`**

#### 1. **Write a Test Log Entry**
You can write a test log entry using the `logger` command, which sends messages to the system logs:
```bash
logger "Test log entry to verify /var/log redirection"
```

#### 2. **Search for the Log Entry**
Use `journalctl` to search for the message in the logs:
```bash
journalctl | grep "Test log entry to verify /var/log redirection"
```

You should see the test log message in the output. For example:
```
Dec 23 12:34:56 hostname user[1234]: Test log entry to verify /var/log redirection
```

---

### **Verify Logs Are on the SSD**
1. Check if the log message is stored on the SSD:
   ```bash
   grep "Test log entry to verify /var/log redirection" /mnt/d1/log/*
   ```

2. Confirm that no logs are being written to the MMC (if itâ€™s still accessible):
   ```bash
   grep "Test log entry to verify /var/log redirection" /var/log/*
   ```

   Since `/var/log` is now symlinked to `/mnt/d1/log`, the second command should only show results if everything is properly redirected.

### **Clean Up the Test**
After confirming the setup, you can remove the test log entry from the journal:
```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=2G
```

---

### Why This Test is Better
- **Realistic Validation**: It simulates actual log writes from system processes, ensuring that all components (journald, symlinks, etc.) are working as expected.
- **End-to-End Verification**: Confirms that logs are redirected to the SSD and not written to the MMC.
- **No Dummy Files**: Avoids creating temporary files that aren't representative of real log activity.

This method gives you confidence that your logs are being redirected correctly and MMC writes are avoided.
