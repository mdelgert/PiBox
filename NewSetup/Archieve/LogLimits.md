If `sudo journalctl | grep "test log entry"` is working, it confirms that `systemd-journald` is functioning correctly and is managing your logs. This means your current setup is working as intended, and there is no need to install `rsyslog` or make additional changes unless you have specific requirements.

---

### **What This Means**
- **Logging is Operational**: Logs are being captured and managed by `journald`. You can access them using the `journalctl` command.
- **Persistent Logs**: Since you see a `/mnt/d1/logs/journal` directory, logs are stored persistently on the SSD, as intended.

---

### **What You Should Do Next**

#### **1. Monitor and Verify Logs**
You can continue to monitor logs using `journalctl`. Some useful commands include:
- View all logs:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl
  ```
- View logs since the last boot:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -b
  ```
- View real-time logs:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -f
  ```

#### **2. Check Storage Usage**
Ensure logs don’t consume excessive space on your SSD. Use the following command to check disk usage:
```bash
du -sh /mnt/d1/logs
```

If logs grow too large, you can configure log rotation and size limits in `journald`.

---

### **Optional: Configure Journald for Log Limits**
Edit the `journald.conf` file to control the size of your logs:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Add or modify these settings:
```ini
[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=500M
SystemKeepFree=100M
SystemMaxFileSize=50M
```

Restart `journald` to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

---

### **Summary**
Your logging system is working correctly with `journald`. No additional changes are necessary unless you have specific needs for traditional log files (`syslog`) or advanced log management. Focus on monitoring storage usage and ensuring logs don’t fill up your SSD over time.
